        <p>Here, it is our greatest pleasure to help you get to know <em>Sheev Palpatine</em>, the almighty Darth Sidious:</p>

           <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Sheev Palpatine was born in the year 82 BBY on the planet Naboo. He lived a rather quiet childhood until the year 65 BBY,
              when at 17 years old he murdered his father and pledged allegiance to the Sith Lord <em>Darth Plageuis, the wise</em>. After
               many years of training and living a double life as an apprentice and senator of Naboo, he became powerful enough in the force
                to murder his master to become Sith Lord, and powerful enough in politics to become the Chancellor of the Republic.</p>
           <p style="text-indent: 50px;">After privately orchestrating the clone wars and manipulatively preparing the fall of the Republic and Jedi Order, he called
              for the execution of Order 66. In this order, the inhibitor chips placed in the clones' brains overrode their own judgement
              and led to the extermination of almost all jedi fighting for the Republic. With the Jedi in hiding and his new apprentice
              Anakin Skywalker, or <em>Darth Vader</em>, serving at his right hand, Palpatine merged his two lives together and formed the
              first Galactic Empire.</p>
           <p style="text-indent: 50px;">It is in your best interest to follow the commands of our Emperor, as it is in his best interest to serve and protect
             the citizens of his Empire. You are in good hands, you will be protected because HE HAS BROUGHT ORDER TO THE GALAXY.</p>
